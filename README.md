# VTU-Student-Assessment-Tool

A desktop app which fetches the student results from VTU servers and populates on the dashboard. The intuition was to mitigate the workload of the professor on keeping every student records on a register after examination. The app is built using python (PyQT5 + Beautiful Soup + sqlite3 ) and CSS, and some of the app features include
Fetching all the students results data by class and semester.
Searching particular student details on the dashboard.
Plotting the Histogram and Std. Deviation graph on the class to understand how many students are outperforming and underperforming.
Also shows student trends over the semesters.
